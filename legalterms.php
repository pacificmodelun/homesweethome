                <b>Pacific Model United Nations Legal Terms and Code of Conduct</b></p>

As a Delegate, Staff Member, Secretariat Member, Volunteer, Adviser, Chaperone, or Attendee at Pacific Model United Nations, I agree to the following legal terms:
<ol>
	<li>I authorize Pacific Model United Nations (“PACMUN”), PACMUN’s agents, successors, assigns and designees to record my name, likeness, voice, other related biographical materials, or otherwise (collectively, “Recording”), edit such Recording, use such Recording in materials related to PACMUN, including but not limited to promotion and advertising materials, and own the copyright therein to use the Recording, or any part thereof, throughout the world in perpetuity, in any markets, manner, formats and media, whether now known or hereafter developed. The Recording shall be used and disposed of, without limitation, at the sole discretion of PACMUN.</li>
	<li>For the safety and comfort of all participants, PACMUN will be a drug and alcohol-free environment. The term “drug” refers to substances including, but not limited to, inhalants, prescription medication used without authorization from a physician, as well as illicit and illegal substances. This does not include over-the-counter drugs used with the permission by a physician or legal guardian, or prescription medication being used as directed by a physician. As a delegate, teacher, chaperone, photographer, Staff member, Secretariat, or any associated or registered person at PACMUN, I agree to not be in possession of or be under the influence of drugs or alcohol for the duration of the conference.</li>
	<li> For the safety of all participants, no horseplay, roughhousing, use of harsh language, or other acts of physical or verbal abuse, unintentional or intentional will be tolerated at PACMUN. Additionally, sexual misconduct by any Staff member, Secretariat member, Delegate, Volunteer, Chaperone, and Adviser (collectively, “Participant”) will not be tolerated and will result in expulsion from the conference.</li>
	<li>If leaving the hotel, the Secretariat and/or Staff must be notified by a designated adult or student. All conference Participants, are required to be in the hotel at all times except during designated meal times as specified by the official conference schedule. All delegates are to be in their designated rooms by curfew which is outlined in the official conference schedule. Advisers and Chaperones will perform room checks to ensure all delegates are in their designated rooms. Delegates will not leave their rooms after curfew. Should an emergency situation arise, I agree to notify the Secretariat and my Teacher or Chaperone before leaving the room after curfew.  I agree to assume responsibility for any damages arising from negligence of these rules.</li>
	<li>No delegate will be allowed in the room of someone of the opposite gender without receiving prior permission from his or her designated Chaperone or Teacher.</li>
	<li>No delegate may skip or leave in the middle of a committee session without prior permission of their Dais. An exception will be made only for illness or other emergency situations. All delegates must notify his or her designated Chaperone or Teacher and a Secretariat or Staff member if they need to skip a committee session.</li>
	<li>All delegates will be required to wear western business attire during all committee sessions, including the midnight crisis. Delegates not in proper attire will be asked to change.</li>
	<li>I agree to the Technology Policy which is as follows: During all committee sessions, cellular phones are required to be turned off or placed in silent mode. Use of cellular phones is not permitted committee session. Laptops are permitted as long as they are not connected to the internet. No internet will be provided during committee sessions.  Should this policy be violated, the Dais will first issue a warning, and then inform the Secretariat. In order to share Resolution Papers among delegates and Dias members, use of USB drives is encouraged. Use of cellphones and use of laptops connected to internet will be permitted outside of committee sessions. This policy is also accessible <a href="Conference/confpolicies.php">here.</a></li>
	<li>I agree to the Refund Policy, which is as follows:  No refunds will be given unless the conference does not occur or the cancellation arises from medical issues, force majeure, or other circumstances arising beyond reasonable control. These cases will be reviewed on an individual basis. This policy is also accessible <a href="Conference/confpolicies.php">here.</a></li>
	<li>I agree to abide by all logistical measures previously agreed upon by Pacific Model United Nations and the Westin Seattle. Namely, I understand that the use of any incidentals, including but not limited to, the mini-fridge, room service, and per-pay-view television will incur fees that I am responsible for paying before departing PACMUN 2016. No delegate is allowed to use the pool or hot tub. I agree to take full responsibility for any damages to hotel and PACMUN property arising from my actions.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
        <p>Considering many of the terms in this agreement are in line with many school behavior policies, teacher sponsors and chaperones are ultimately responsible for the behavior of members of their respective delegations. However, PACMUN reserves the right to remove individuals in violation of this agreement from the conference.

I agree to assume responsibility, financial or legal, for consequences or damages arising from my negligence of these terms and conditions.

I agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Pacific Model United Nations from and against all claims, demands, causes of action, and liabilities arising from my breach of these terms and conditions, which are also accessible at <a href="legalterms.php">pacificmun.com/legalterms.php</a>
