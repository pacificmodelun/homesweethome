<h2>About PACMUN</h2>
<p>
PACMUN’s mission is to spread awareness of the United Nations, to motivate students to become more actively involved in local and global affairs, and to inspire students to change the world. PACMUN was founded to empower student leaders in the community. PACMUN started as a collaborative effort between delegates from Tacoma, Kent, Bellevue, Issaquah, and Seattle. The secretariat and staff consist completely of high-school students, who have both the drive and the experience to make PACMUN an amazing conference.
</p>
<p>
PACMUN began as a student run conference in 2014. The idea was conceived by seven extraordinary students to make a universally accessible MUN conference to all students in the Pacific Northwest. PACMUN is the first student-run conference in Washington State, and it its inaugural year, it became the largest conference in the state. The conference has grown since then, with the leadership of new secretariats and the guidance from years past.

                <p>Trevor Mueller is currently a senior at the International Community School in Kirkland. Having previously served on multiple secretariats and as president of his club, he can’t wait to apply his management experience to make PACMUN 2017 the best year yet. Although at times it seems like his life is nothing but Model United Nations, in his free time he enjoys music, weightlifting and hikes with his dog in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Trevor is amazingly proud of what PACMUN has become, and is excited to build upon past conferences to continue to expand our horizons and lead delegates into the complex, ever-changing world of international politics.</p>

Besides being one of the few carnivores on secretariat, he has been involved with PACMUN since its inaugural session in 2014, as a delegate. He was the USG of delegate affairs for the 2015 conference, and served as the director general at the 2016 conference. He is the president of the Bellarmine MUN club, and is amazingly excited to see all of the delegates in November. When not running conferences, MacKinley can be found pretending to do homework, waiting in line at track meets, and playing the saxophone.</p>

                <p>Megan Munson is a senior at Inglemoor High School, and is extremely excited to be serving as a Co-Chief of Staff for PACMUN 2017. Outside of MUN, Megan rock climbs, ignores significantly more homework than an IB student should, and is a part of her school’s nationally-ranking newspaper. She is also a vegetarian and has two cats (Molly and Koko!). As Megan’s first conference, PACMUN 2015 is entirely responsible for sucking her into the various staff and secretariat roles Megan has seen during her MUN career. Being a part of PACMUN 2017’s secretariat has been a dream since she saw the panel of professional-looking upperclassmen two years ago, and Megan is eternally grateful to have seen this dream come true. Megan is extremely hyped for this conference and is beyond honored to be a part of this organization.</p>

                <p>Kelsey Braford is a senior at Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma, Washington. When she first became involved with Model UN her sophomore year, she immediately fell in love with it because it offers a safe place to debate international issues, improve communication skills, and, of course, make new friends! PACMUN holds a special place in her heart as it was the first conference she ever attended, and the first conference she staffed. Outside of MUN, she frequently volunteers for YMCA Camp Seymour and her church. In her free time, you can find her exploring the gorgeous wilderness of Olympic National Park, playing with her hamster, eating copious amounts of vegetables, or building blanket forts in her living room. She welcomes delegates to PACMUN 2017, and looks forward to a successful weekend in November!</p>

Besides being the Director-General for PACMUN 2017, he has attended ten MUN conventions as a delegate and staffed five more in his long Model UN career. He currently is the Secretary-General of the Interlake Model UN club and EDUMUN 2017. Outside of Model UN, Arun is a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, a member of the Interlake Knowledge Bowl team, a proud survivor of the IB diploma program, one of the few omnivores on the Secretariat, and an inveterate world traveler. He’s convinced that PACMUN 2017 will be the best yet!</p>

                <p>Shawdi is a senior in the Cambridge Program at Juanita High School. Entering her fourth year of MUN, she has been consistently “blown” away by the diplomacy, insight, and integrity of the delegates she has encountered throughout her conference experience in the Pacific Northwest. Whether it be through her work as a committee Director (including at PACMUN 2016!), a multi-year leader of her school’s MUN club, or organizing a conference for middle-schoolers, Shawdi is dedicated to expanding the PNW’s MUN landscape. When she’s not obsessively perusing Google News or debating at the dinner table, you’ll find Shawdi (attempting to) play tennis, drawing, toying with calculus problems, fervently performing Rachmaninoff on the piano, or volunteering as an NHS board member. Honored and beyond grateful to serve as PACMUN’s USG of Finance, Shawdi looks forward to providing delegates old and new with a platform from which to change the world, just as PACMUN’s inaugural conference did for her.</p>

Being a part of PACMUN for the past three years, she has had one of the most fabulous experiences working with the Staff and Secretariat. She was a delegate in PACMUN 2015 and the Assistant Director for the UN Office on Drugs and Crime at PACMUN 2016. Heading the Media Team this year has been an especially rewarding project. Other than Model United Nations, she acts for school productions, eats hearty vegetarian food, watches Netflix and thinks about college. Nikita hopes delegates and Staff members will have an amazing PACMUN 2017!</p>

Besides attending and staffing conferences up and down the West Coast, she fills her days with photography, German culture, and singing with her choir family. Her hobbies include not eating meat, hiking, dancing badly but enthusiastically, and teaching her class of kindergarteners how to ski at Stevens Pass. In the future, she hopes to somehow combine biochemistry and computer science in some kind of “Black Mirror”-esque career and also travel into outer space.  As enchanted by the possibilities of global collaboration and citizenship as this secretariat is with watching Netflix, Angelus can’t wait to see all that the delegates of PACMUN 2017 can achieve at the conference.</p>

As well as being the furthest secretariat member away from the Seattle area, Michelle is a whole-hearted omnivore and avid orange-eater. She is delighted to welcome delegates to PACMUN 2017 and looks forward to working with the rest of secretariat to make PACMUN 2017 a fantastic and memorable experience for all!</p>

                <p>Khushi Chaudhari is a senior at Redmond High School. She started doing Model UN in 7th grade when her teacher signed her up for it without her knowledge. Dreading the day of her first conference, she found herself taking the first step into what would turn into a 6 year long journey. After attending over 8 conferences as a delegate, serving on multiple secretariats, and being president of her club, she is glad that she was forced to attend that first conference. When not engaging in anything MUN related, you can find her training at her karate dojo, rummaging the fridge for vegetables, watching Netflix and searching for new places to travel to. Model UN has had a tremendous impact on her life and she hopes to make PACMUN 2017 a conference to remember!</p>
