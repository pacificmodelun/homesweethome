            <p>Thank you for visiting our resources page! We are happy to announce our new <span style="color:#1792A7;">community program</span>!

<br><br>PACMUN is not just a conference--it is a community. As the first high school run MUN conference in the state of Washington, PACMUN not only offers the immersive and engaging MUN experience to its delegates that only a hotel conference can provide, but it is also offers the opportunity for students to organize, lead, and initiate this experience. Ever since the inception of this high-school run hotel conference, we have not only been renowned for our conference quality within the PNW MUN circuit, but we have also witnessed the rapid expansion of MUN chapters across Washington State.

<br><br>PACMUN consistently strives to give back to its amazing community, and with our <span style="color:#1792A7;">community program</span> we hope to achieve just that. Through this program, PACMUN provides consultative services to both MUN clubs, advisors, and delegates who are looking to start a new chapter, organize a convention, improve the quality of their meetings, or simply learn more about the PNW MUN circuit. A description of our services can be found at the bottom of this page. <span style="color:#1792A7;">To request a service please follow <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/pacificmun.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScP6zOeO-eEqZlz4sKJ82E5MIG19YGsV9IJqihTjvIh0_Ce2A/viewform">this link</a></b> and fill out the form.</span>

<br><br>In addition to this new program we also offer resources to assist both beginner and experienced delegates before and during their time at PACMUN. These resources can be found below and all of them can be downloaded and used as your discretion.

<br><br>Many of these resources were created for Educational Model United Nations (EDUMUN), an annual one day pre-PACMUN delegate and staff training event consisting of various seminars for attendees to learn and prepare for PACMUN. Delegates are highly encouraged to attend this event to improve their performance and experience during PACMUN. Follow <b><a href="http://www.munnorthwest.org/edumun/" style="color: #1792A7">this link</a></b> to learn more about EDUMUN and how you can use it to your advantage when preparing for PACMUN.

<br><br>As always, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at sg@pacificmun.com!

                <h2>Available Services</h2>
<h4>For Delegates</h4>
<p>
The EDUMUN Package is a crash course in MUN for your club. Two of our consultants will come into your club meeting for an interactive 2-hour presentation. Topics covered include ROP, Debate and Resolution Writing. The session concludes with a 30-minute mock committee for delegates to apply what they have learned.
            </p>
            <h4>For Club Leadership</h4>

<p>Struggling to grow your club? Overwhelmed with MUN registration? Hurting for funds to attend conferences? With our Club Leadership Package, we can organize your club, help you set up successful fundraisers, and help you register for in-state, out-of-state, and out-of-country conferences. </p>

            <h4>For Conference Organizers</h4>
<p>
Setting up an MUN conference is no easy task. Starting from scratch can make it seem impossible, but with this package, weâ€™ll put you in contact with a former Secretariat member who can guide you through the process of finding a venue, acquiring and training staff, and planning logistics for a conference.
