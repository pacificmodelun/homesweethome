            <div class="description"><p>Welcome to the European Union, a group of 28 European nations forming an observer state to the United Nations. Due to the sheer amount of participating member states, the Union is considered to be an international superpower. Officially designated as a politico-economic union, the organization was begun on November 1, 1993 in the Netherlands by the Maastricht Treaty. </p>
            <p>The European Union acts as an umbrella for numerous sub-organizations, but primarily focuses on strengthening external and internal human rights, organizing the economy (the standardization of the Euro), and regulating the market. The Union also focuses on spreading and reinforcing democracy through transparency within member governments. 
            </p>
            <p>While the EU does not have voting rights within the United Nations, its body includes UNSC permanent five members France and the United Kingdom. The committee votes by consensus through the use of directives, which are similar to operative clauses and require a certain amount of signatories. This gives each member state an important vote which has the potential to make or break a resolution. While many observer states, such as the Arab League, do not hold the authority to speak before the UN, the EU is unique in its ability to join the international debate by writing proposals, contributing to amendments, and submitting resolutions. </p>
            <p>Position Papers are mandatory, and must be turned in to the dais by 11:59PM on Nov 6, 2016. The dais’ e-mail address is 
                <a href="mailto:eu@pacificmun.com" target="_top">eu@pacificmun.com</a>. Late position papers will not be considered for an award unless an extension has been requested by the delegate and approved by the dais at least 24 hours in advance.</p>

                <p>Phoebe Liebling will be directing the European Union at PACMUN 2016. She is a senior at Bainbridge High School, and serves as co-president of the BHS Model UN delegation. She began participation in Model UN in 7th grade, and was hooked by the opportunity to be a real, live diplomat at the age of thirteen.

She hopes delegates will use this conference as an opportunity to expand their worldview and visualize their own place within the international community. </p>
