            <div class="description"><p>The International Court of Justice is a completely unique body within the scope of Model United Nations. Rather than a council of delegates representing the interests of their member states, justices and advocates together arbitrate international law. The ICJ is perhaps the most dynamic committee in Model United Nations, relying entirely upon delegates’ grasp of international law. However, it is also one of the most rewarding, as its entirely driven by the delegates perceptions and interpretations rather than country policy. In the ICJ, delegates can and will reshape international law and change the course of history. In the 7 decades of its existence, the ICJ has prosecuted war criminals, redrawn international borders and had a tremendous impact upon the global community as a whole. </p>

                <h5>Director</h5>
                <p>Shawdi is a junior in the Cambridge Program at Juanita High School. PACMUN’s inaugural conference was also her first conference, so she is extremely excited and honored to start off her third year in MUN (and fifth conference!) as Director of the ICJ, a committee near and dear to her heart. Shawdi’s believes that anyone who is willing to understand the nuances of global issues can be successful in making our planet a more positive place, and she continues to spread her passion for MUN and its values as former VP and current advisor of her school’s MUN club. When she’s not perusing the politics section of Google News, you’ll find Shawdi at a piano, volunteering as VP of her local NHS chapter, happily mulling over a difficult calculus problem, or doodling on the nearest piece of paper.</p>
