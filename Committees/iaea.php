            <div class="description"><p>Founded on the 29th of July, 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)’s stated goal is to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy. Atoms for Peace, created by the US President Eisenhower, was the first attempt at addressing nuclear energy. This organization found that the topic of atomic energy needed to be reviewed on a worldwide level. Therefore the IAEA was born. The purview of the IAEA centers around the use or misuse of nuclear energy, the prevention and amelioration of nuclear catastrophe, and the use of nuclear technology in other fields. The IAEA’s primary work areas are nuclear technology and applications, nuclear safety and security, and safeguards and verification. The IAEA has significant authority in its specific area, but avoids extending its power outside its domain. Nuclear energy poses controversy worldwide and the IAEA was created in order to recognize these problems. The pursue for finding solutions for peace and security in the technologically advancing world is the IAEA’s mission, it will provide assistance in ensuring that atomic energy will not be used in a way to further military purpose.</p><p>As a committee, the IAEA is on the larger side of the spectrum. Delegates will be expected to represent their specific country policies faithfully and accurately. Delegates who are unsure as to what that may entail should ask the dais. The IAEA as a committee is more suited to intermediate delegates with some experience in MUN.</p>
            <p>Position Papers are mandatory, and must be turned in to the dais by 11:59PM on Nov 6, 2016. The dais’ e-mail address is 
                <a href="mailto:IAEA@pacificmun.com" target="_top">IAEA@pacificmun.com</a>. Late position papers will not be considered for an award unless an extension has been requested by the delegate and approved by the dais at least 24 hours in advance.</p>
            <p>Further questions or inquiries can be directed to the dais at 
                <a href="mailto:IAEA@pacificmun.com" target="_top">IAEA@pacificmun.com</a>.</p></div>
