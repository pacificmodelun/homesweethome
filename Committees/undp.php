            <div class="description"><p>The benefits of globalization and industrialization have not been felt equally by all parts of the world. While some countries have enjoyed economic success, decrease in poverty, and access to information, others have been left in the dust. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was created in 1965 in order to address these very issues. Currently, the UNDP works in approximately 170 countries and territories, helping them develop policies, skills, and institutional capabilities to ensure sustainable development, democratic governance and peacebuilding, as well as climate and disaster resilience. By 2014, the UNDP had created nearly 1 million jobs; strengthened the livelihoods of low-income communities; combated climate change; registered 18 million new voters; trained 2 million health workers to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and improved energy access for 1.3 million people. As a result of its inclusive and efficient organization, the UNDP was judged the most transparent development agency by the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) and one of the development partners that communicates most frequently with host government counterparts. At the PACMUN Conference, the UNDP will be discussing accessibility of sustainable energy in developing nations as well as availability of quality education in post-conflict areas. Such discussion and collective problem-solving among delegates committed to sustainable development will be a step towards a stronger and more equal global community.</p>
