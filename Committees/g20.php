The G20 is seen as an important body as its members control 85% of the world’s product, 80% of the global trade and two third’s of the world’s population. The main goal of the G20 is to serve as a forum to entertain discourse on international financial sustainability and economic cooperation.The G20 also works on stimulating and growing the economic infrastructure of developing nations and facilitating global trade. As the G20 has grown in influence, it has begun to address other global situations as well. Annual summits are held with some of the most powerful heads of state and communiqué (G20 version of a UN resolution) is issued to address these pressing topics.</p>

                <p>My name is Neav Topaz, and I’m super excited to serve as your director for the Group of 20 committee for PACMUN 2016! I’m a senior at Tesla STEM High School and have been the Vice President of my school’s Model United Nations club for 2 years and president starting this year. Aside from MUN, I participate in FBLA, NHS, Redmond’s Relay for Life and I’m on the Cabinet for my Temple Youth Group. I enjoy global politics, world history, future predictions, maps, edm, rap, photography, traveling, business and of course Netflix. I’m a really chill director and I put a large emphasis on personal growth. However, I do take MUN seriously and I really enjoy delegates who put in a lot of effort.  I expect this conference to be awesome and hope to see some Washington MUN stars being born.</p>

                <p>My name is Zach Forbes, and I am thrilled to be your chair for the Group of 20 committee at PACMUN 2016. I am currently a sophomore at Bellarmine College Preparatory School in Tacoma and am involved in my school’s Model UN Club (obviously). This is my first time staffing a conference, and I could not be more excited for PACMUN. Besides MUN, I am involved in musical and dramatic theatre, choir, ASB, Knowledge Bowl, multiple clubs, and help run my school’s annual food drive. In my little free time I enjoy skiing, sleeping, watching Netflix, and spending time with my nephew. I have great hopes for this committee and I am psyched to see where it goes.</p>
