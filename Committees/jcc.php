            <div class="description"><p>Are you a daring delegate ready for a mind-bending, fast-paced debate? The Joint Crisis Committee is a challenging, out-of-the-box MUN experience, where the circumstances are ever changing and where you never know who can be trusted. The longstanding MUN values of diplomacy and collaboration are replaced with international espionage, aggressive debates, and evolving circumstances. Feud with your friends and keep your enemies close in a world where literally anything can happen.</p>
                
            <p>JCC, unlike a traditional MUN committee, consists of two independently running blocs whose opposing views and goals create a heated debate. Instead of resolutions, delegates will pass public or private directives with the power to immediately affect the nature of the perpetual crisis at hand. From recovering from a World War to tensions between Arctic territory, the stakes are high as you and your fellow bloc members are here to avert the crisis. If the bloc is to achieve their desired goals, all delegates are expected to think rapidly, act decisively, and resolve crises using imaginative solutions.</p>
                
            <p>As a continuous crisis, JCC is intended for delegates who are prepared to think on their feet, participate in a high level of debate, and keep in mind who the real enemy is.</p>
