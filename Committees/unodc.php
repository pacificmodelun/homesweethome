            <div class="description"><p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is the leading UN body pertaining to the issues of international crime and illicit drugs. As a General Assembly programme comprised of over 150 Member States, UNODC has advisory power, but cannot force actions upon sovereign nations. This committee has jurisdiction over a wide variety of topics, ranging from the black market organ trade to terrorism prevention. In the past, UNODC has prioritized illicit drug and firearm trades, as well as topics such as wildlife crime and corruption. Established in 1997, UNODC focuses primarily on the cooperation of Member States to discuss and implement legislature to counter these global conflicts. Ninety percent of funds are appropriated by governments to UNODC voluntarily, providing a large sum of money to enact future programs. </p>
                
            <p>Given the diversity of Member States and their individual objectives, delegates can expect to foster cooperation in the midst of immense controversy. In-depth research and critical thinking will stimulate debate, so delegates will experience exciting, productive committee sessions!</p>
