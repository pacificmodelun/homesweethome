            <div class="description"><p>The General Assembly (GA) was founded in 1945 under the Charter of the United Nations and features 193 member states. Although there are six international bodies of the United Nations, for the purposes of this conference we will be assuming the role of all the bodies. The General Assembly is central in policy making with regards to international issues while promoting peace; which is in reflected in the 2005 Summit Outcome Document, that addressed development, security, human rights, and United Nations reform.The General Assembly is in charge of overall debate pertaining to all countries that usually include a variety of world affairs. It is the main policymaking body of the UN and has debate proposals brought to by different member states. Establishing a budget is also a main function of the GA. They vote on how much each member state should pay to maintain membership in the UN. General Assembly voting is not population based and maintains a one state-one vote policy, which allows equal representation and equal voting methods. This also means that countries that make up a small portion of overall world population can pass resolutions with a two-thirds majority. </p>
