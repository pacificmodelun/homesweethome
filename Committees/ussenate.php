            <div class="description"><p>The United State Senate is one of the 2 chambers that make up the US Legislative Branch. Composed of 100 members, 2 from each of the 50 states, the purpose of the Senate is to help deliberate legislation, confirm executive nominations, ratify treaties, and much more as the upper house of the US Government. The powers granted to the Senate are found in Article 1 Section 3 of the US Constitution, and help guide the Senate through its responsibilities even today. Senators are elected every 6 years, so unlike most MUN committees, where countries are usually permanently present, Senators must take into account the opinions of the states they represent, or face the consequences of being voted out of office. The rules of order for the United State Senate at PACMUN vary slightly to those of other committees, so if Senators want to get an idea of how debate will flow, the Senate Rules of Order are a good place to start. While the exact format for debate and procedure for PACMUN US Senate are still being worked out, Senators will be provided with more information about how debate will flow as we get closer to the conference. If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to email us! The Senate is an advanced committee, so be aware that if you choose to represent a high ranking senator (Majority Leader, Whip, etc.) some extra responsibilities may be asked of you. We can't wait to see you all at PACMUN!</p>
