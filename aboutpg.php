<h2>About PACMUN</h2>
<p>
PACMUN’s mission is to spread awareness of the United Nations, to motivate students to become more actively involved in local and global affairs, and to inspire students to change the world. PACMUN was founded to empower student leaders in the community. PACMUN started as a collaborative effort between delegates from Tacoma, Kent, Bellevue, Issaquah, and Seattle. The secretariat and staff consist completely of high-school students, who have both the drive and the experience to make PACMUN an amazing conference.
</p>
<p>
PACMUN began as a student run conference in 2014. The idea was conceived by seven extraordinary students to make a universally accessible MUN conference to all students in the Pacific Northwest. PACMUN is the first student-run conference in Washington State, and it its inaugural year, it became the largest conference in the state. The conference has grown since then, with the leadership of new secretariats and the guidance from years past.
</p>
    <p style="color: #b3babc;">Pacific Model United Nations is a registered non-profit organization in the state of WA and is a federal tax exempt 501c(3) organization designated as a public charity by the Internal Revenue Service</p>

                <p>Crystal is currently a senior attending Interlake High School. When she is not designing the 78th iteration of the PACMUN logo, Crystal is either captaining for the Interlake Girls Swim Team, inhaling goldfish crackers, or filling out the same field trip form for the umteenth time, inundated by Interlake High School's egregious bureaucratic red tape. With a firm belief that PACMUN will eventually grow to become one of the largest high school MUN conventions in North America, Crystal eagerly awaits the debut of PACMUN 2016, where she will have the opportunity to observe delegates and staff members explore the labyrinth of collaborative possibilities to find cogent solutions for the global issues of today.</p>

He is excited to meet all the new faces to PACMUN and hopes the conference is an amazing delegate experience.</p>

David enjoys at least 30 minutes of his day watching House of Cards, Parks and Recreation, Brian Williams, The Walking Dead, Korean Dramas, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and The Real Housewives of Orange County. He enjoys listening to Classical Baroque, as well as EDM, Jazz, Tupac, Biggie Smalls, Diddy, Action Bronson, Kanye, Unknown Rappers, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Tim McGraw.

On winter weekends that she’s not at a MUN conference, Angelus is a ski instructor at Steven’s Pass. She also likes hiking and dance, even if she’s not very good at either activity. Enchanted by the possibilities of global collaboration, Angelus can’t wait to see all that the delegates of PACMUN 2016 can achieve.</p>

Rina stumbled into MUN at the beginning of her sophomore year, and found herself quickly sucked into its deep, dark, depths as she jumped from an awkward PACMUN delegate in 2014, to the slightly less awkward Assistant Director of UNODC in 2015, to the (hopefully) even less awkward co-USG of Delegate Affairs this year! She's absolutely ecstatic to see all of you in action at the conference, and wishes you all the best!</p>

Being a junior at International School, this is her first experience on Secretariat. However, when she’s not replying to emails or assigning rooms as the co-Delegate Affairs, you can see Rachel writing grants for her beloved Robotics team, planning events for her ASB, letting out tunes on her viola, practicing kendo, or madly researching new genetic/psychological discoveries!  Rachel is absolutely honored to have worked on Secretariat for the PNW's finest delegates, and hopes that all the delegates are as thrilled as she is, for PACMUN 2016!</p>
